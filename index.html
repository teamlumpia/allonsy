					"Sometimes there comes a point when you are presented an opportunity to improve your business, and you didn't know you even needed it. After casually reaching out to Allons-Y! (Consulting) after seeing another project they worked on, they provided a detailed examination of what they felt would best benefit my small business. They reached back out to me quickly to chat about what options I should consider for a quick online/ social media marketing spot to boost the visuals of the business page. They examined the current trends and what would align with my product and services. The process was basically seamless, as they list the items they needed to begin crafting a media post to improve the visibility of my products. Within a couple of hours of sending the files to their creative department, they reached out to me with the full plan and what was to be produced. Needless to say, the turnaround was swift, of great quality, and comes highly recommended to those looking to jump into updating their social media presence. It's rare that you go through a process and don't run into hurdles along the way, but with open lines of communication and a listening person on the other end, their services were a gem of a find. Contacting them was time and money well spent. Thanks again for your help guys."

					"As first-time owner and operators of a business, the simplest tasks from
					purchasing to accounting can be very difficult. We decided to use Allons-y for our
					marketing needs. Working with Aaron has been a breeze. He is helping us with
					our social media presence and our direct sales techniques. He is always quick to
					respond and has great ideas about getting our name and business out in the
					community. Since working with Aaron and Allons-y we have been featured at our
					local Public Market and will hopefully be featured at some of our many local
					festivals (COVID-19 dependent)."
